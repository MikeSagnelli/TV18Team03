This repository is used for a development of a VR experience using Unity 2017.3 & Google VR SDK.

## Objective
The project is called Taller Vertical, and it is an activity sponsored by Google & powered by Wizeline. Moreover, it is hosted at Tec de Monterrey Campus Guadalajara in Mexico. The task is to develop in one week "something" using Virtual Reality or Augmented Reality focusing on one of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals.

## Sustainable Development Goal To Focus On

[![Foo](http://globaldaily.com/wp-content/themes/globaldaily/images/goals-1.gif "SDG #1 No Poverty")](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg1)


End poverty in all its forms everywhere
In signing Agenda 2030, governments around the world committed to ending poverty in all its manifestations, including its most extreme forms, over the next 15 years.

## What are we doing?

Using Unity & Google VR SDK we are going to develop an interactive experience where the user dives into an immersive low-poly universe. The user has to survive just like people in extreme poverty conditions do. There is a narrator that guides you into your adventure, but be careful, as there are dangerous places where you might be stalked, and attacked. This experience tries to make people aware on the living conditions that people in extreme poverty face every day. Survive your way to your humble home, and take whatever resources you can gather for yourself or for other members of your family.

## Team
